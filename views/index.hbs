    <h4>Welcome to CraftTogether.</h4>
	<p>
	This is going to be a project to bring together the development community back together and introduce new developer to the standards of older developers. Your goal? To write a free standing network from scratch. This is a project run by <a href="https://twitter.com/minecoder" target="_blank">@minecoder</a> and will consist of a main team of operations members, and you, the developers.
	<br><br>
	There is no set direction, that is to be decided by the developer community and what they want. You can decide to make minigames or even have a survivial based server, if you build it. I'm looking to make this one of the real community driven servers.
	<br><br>
	Rules:
		<ul>
			<li>Do not post any code/conent you do not have the licence for.</li>
			<li>Do not hardcode any user specific actions/permissions into the code, these will be decided by the operations team.</li>
			<li>
			<li>Do not attack/target anyone through the use of code/comments/actions.</li>
		</ul>
